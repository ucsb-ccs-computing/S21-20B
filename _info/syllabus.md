# About the Course

## Course Description:

This is intended as a SECOND course in Computing for non-majors. It is a follow up to the course described here:

https://ccs.ucsb.edu/courses/2021/winter/intro-cs-non-majors

This is an intermediate course in programming in Python. The pre-requisite is the course at the link above, CMPSC 8, or equivalent programming experience. The intention is to offer a course that goes beyond the basics, cover intermediate computer science topics and data structures, and enables students to produce useful software in Python to solve problems arising in their own discipline (e.g. Art, Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Mathematics, Music Composition, Physics, or Writing and Literature).
